 class Solution:            
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        if n < 3:
            return 0
        
        primes = [1]*n
        primes[0] = primes[1] = 0

        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
            if primes[i]:
                for j in range(i*i, n, i):
                    primes[j] = 0
        
            
        return sum(primes)


# Time Complexity ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The loop starts from 2 and marks every multiple of 2. Therefore for input size of n, this loop would run for n/2 indexes. Similarly for i = 3, the loop would run 
for n/3 indexes and so on for every prime number encountered

Therefore the total # of runs : n/2 + n/3 + n/5 + n/7 + ... 
This is a harmonic series and we find the sum for this which log(log n)

So total time complexity = O(n*log(log n))
